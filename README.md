# NetworkToolkit

This project contains networking primitives for use with .NET. It can be obtained from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NetworkToolkit/).

This is a bit of a prototyping playground right now and APIs may not be stable.

## HTTP Primitives

NetworkToolkit provides a lower-level HTTP client that prioritizes performance and flexibility.

## Connection Abstractions

Connection abstractions used to abstract establishment of `Stream`-based connections.
